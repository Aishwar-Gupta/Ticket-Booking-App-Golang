# Ticket-Booking-App-Golang
A system for booking event tickets for the users and maintaining a reservation list for the management.

**TICKET RESERVATION SYSTEM:**
The program continuously asks user inputs to determine the event that a user wants to attend or
exit the service followed by the user details such as name, age, gender, and email along with the
number of tickets to be bought. The program validates the user inputs and prints the tickets as
an output while maintaining the reservation list which is printed at the end of the program. 
The program validates the inputs and checks if the seats are available after every reservation 
made using the service.

The program uses GO Routines to separate the thread of printing tickets to the user and struct
array to store the reservation list with user details.

The project is used for learning the basics of GOLANG programming language.
